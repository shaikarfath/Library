## Testing

For the testing part, we are using two different types of testing for the front-end and the back-end.

>>Front-end testing

For the front-end testing, we are using `Protractor`

>>>How to Install

### For WINDOWS

- The basic step is to go to the repository and download the Zip file
    - The downloaded file will be saved under downloades on your pc
    - Unzip/ extract the file 
    - On a command prompt, the project needs to be pulled up and the commands will be as follows 
        - `cd downloads`
        - `cd Library-test`
        - `cd Library-test`
    - And since the packages are not installed to run the program, the next steps will be to install the necessary packages
- First step is to install Node JS on Windows
    - On a browser, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the desired version for your Windows
    - Verify the installation by opening a command prompt on windows and type the following command `node -v`
- Second step is to install Express package for the project to run
    - On a new command prompt, install express by using the following command `npm install express`
- Third step is to install Axios package for the project
    - On a new command prompt, install axios by using the following command `npm install axios`

- Installing Protractor
    - On a new command prompt, and type `npm install â€“g protractor` to install it globally
    - Once it's installed, then on the same command prompt, type `webdriver-manager update`
    - And the next command is `webdriver-manager start` to start web driver 
    
    Note: Once the web driver is started, if it doesn't run on port 4444, then there is something wrong in the setup. Quit following the next steps and reinstall protractor again.
